This project is a 3D simulation of a solar system created using OpenGL. It features a central sun and eight planets, each with unique properties such as size, color, orbital distance, and speed. The planets orbit the sun in a visually appealing animation, while a rotating torus adds a decorative element at the center. The project demonstrates the use of OpenGL functions for rendering, transformations, and animation, making it a great example of graphical programming and real-time simulation.
